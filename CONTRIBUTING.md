### Contributing to BeadMaker

Thank you for your interest in improving BeadMaker. This project welcomes contributions of all kinds.

### Getting started
- Fork the repo and clone your fork.
- Create a feature branch from `main`.
- Prefer Java 21 LTS (or 17 if blocked) and Gradle once migration lands; until then, Eclipse project files are supported.

### Development workflow
1. Small, focused PRs with clear intent.
2. Write concise descriptions and link related issues.
3. Follow Conventional Commits for commit messages.

### Conventional Commits
- feat: user-facing feature
- fix: bug fix
- refactor: internal restructuring
- perf: performance improvement
- build/ci/chore/docs/style/test: other categories

Examples:
- `feat(ui): add dark theme toggle`
- `build(gradle): add OpenPDF and remove iText`

### Code style
- Use `.editorconfig` settings.
- Prefer descriptive names; avoid 1â€“2 character identifiers.
- Keep methods small; handle edge cases early.

### Reporting vulnerabilities
- See `SECURITY.md` for how to report security issues.

### Code of Conduct
- This project follows the Contributor Covenant. See `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
